<h1>What is Angular?</h1>
<p>Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript</p>
<p>As a platform, Angular includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications</li>
    <li>A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more</li>
    <li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code</li>
</ul>
<p>With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.</p>
